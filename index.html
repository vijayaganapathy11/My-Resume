                <ul>
                    <li>The e-shopping website project aims to create an online platform where users can browse and purchase
                        products or services.</li>
                    <li>The project will focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless shopping
                        experience for customers.</li>
                    <li>I am using a static website, it means that my website consists of pre-designed web pages that do not change
                        dynamically. This type of website is typically created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and does not
                        require server-side processing or a database.</li>

                <h4>Machine Learning, Python, Numpy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generate captions which describe the events of a video automatically. The captions are generated by LSTM/RNN
                        along with encoder-decoder architecture.</li>
                    <li>The captions features are extracted from pretrained VGG16 model and MSVD from Microsoft is used as a
                        dataset.</li>
                    <li>The aim is to leverage deep learning techniques and the capabilities of the Keras tool to extract meaningful
                        information from video data, enabling various video analysis tasks.</li>
